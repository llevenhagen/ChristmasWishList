Issues

##Bought Status Checkbox / Conditionals
In the Present Show Div, we wanted to show whether a present was bought or not by printing an appropriate string (ie: 'still available' vs 'this item has been purchased'), but as of Monday afternoon we are not able to figure it out.

##Computer issues

##POST/PUT issues - magic
After day two, the 'POST' and 'PUT' routes were working in Postman, but not in the app. We intended on addressing this issue the next day, but when we woke up, everything was working. If you need any magic dust, let us know.
